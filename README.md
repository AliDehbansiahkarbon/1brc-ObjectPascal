# 1Ô∏è‚É£üêùüèéÔ∏è The One Billion Row Challenge in Object Pascal

This is the repository that will coordinate the 1 Billion Row Challenge for Object Pascal.

The One Billion Row Challenge (1BRC) is a fun exploration of how far modern Object Pascal can be pushed for aggregating one billion rows from a text file.
Grab all your threads, reach out to SIMD,  or pull any other trick, and create the fastest implementation for solving this task!

The text file contains temperature values for a range of weather stations. Each row is one measurement in the format `<string: station name>;<double: measurement>`, with the measurement value having exactly one fractional digit.
The following shows ten rows as an example:

```
Hamburg;12.0
Bulawayo;8.9
Palembang;38.8
St. John's;15.2
Cracow;12.6
Bridgetown;26.9
Istanbul;6.2
Roseau;34.4
Conakry;31.2
Istanbul;23.0
```

The task is to write an Object Pascal program which reads the file, calculates the min, mean, and max temperature value per weather station, and emits the results on `STDOUT` like this (i.e. sorted alphabetically by station name, and the result values per station in the format `<min>/<mean>/<max>`, rounded to one fractional digit):

```
{Abha=-23.0/18.0/59.2, Abidjan=-16.2/26.0/67.3, Ab√©ch√©=-10.0/29.4/69.0, Accra=-10.1/26.4/66.4, Addis Ababa=-23.7/16.0/67.0, Adelaide=-27.8/17.3/58.5, ...}
```

## Honour Mentions

I'd like to thank [@paweld](https://github.com/paweld) for taking us from my miserable 20m attempt, to a woping 3m, beating the [Python script](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc/blob/main/src/main/python/create_measurements.py) by about 2 minutes.

I'd like to thank [mobius](https://github.com/mobius1qwe) for taking the time to provide the Delphi version of the generator

I found out about it by watching this video about an attempt in Go: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYng524S-MA

## Entering The Challenge

Submissions will be, preferably, as a `GIT` `submodule`.

They must contain the source and a Linux `ELF` binary in 64 bits in a folder named `bin` from the `root` folder.

In order to produce the One Billion Rows of text, we are providing the source code for the official generator, so we all have the same entry data.

We now have both a Lazarus version and a Delphi version of the generator.

For those that are using a Delphi version that is not able to produce a Linux executable binary, please make that known on your `README.md` file.

I'll then compile the source code on my Windows `VM` with Delphi 12.1 and use the generated executable for the benchmark.

Submit your implementation and become part of the leader board!

## Results

These are the results from running all entries into the challenge on my personal computer:
- Ryzen 9 5950x 16 cores
- 32GB RAM
- 250GB SSD
- 1TB HDD

| # | Result (m:s.ms): SSD | Result (m:s.ms): HDD | Submitter     | Notes     | Certificates |
|---|----------------------|----------------------|---------------|-----------|--------------|
|?|?|?|?|?|?|

## Evaluating Results

Results are determined by running the program on:
- Ryzen 9 5950x 16 core
- 32GB RAM
- 250GB SSD
- 1TB HDD

Each contender is run five times in a row for both `SSD` and `HDD` using `hyperfine` for the time taking.
The slowest and the fastest runs are discarded.
The mean value of the remaining three runs is the result for that contender and will be added to the results table above.
The exact same `measurements.txt` file is used for evaluating all contenders.

## Prize

This is being run for bragging rights only and the fun of such a challenge.

## FAQ

_Q: Can I copy code from other submissions?_\
A: Yes, you can. The primary focus of the challenge is about learning something new, rather than "winning". When you do so, please give credit to the relevant source submissions. Please don't re-submit other entries with no or only trivial improvements.

_Q: What is the encoding of the measurements.txt file?_\
A: The file is encoded with UTF-8.

_Q: Which operating system is used for evaluation?_\
A: Ubuntu 23.10.

## Code of Conduct

Be excellent to each other!
More than winning, the purpose of this challenge is to have fun and learn something new.
