# 1Ô∏è‚É£üêùüèéÔ∏è The One Billion Row Challenge in Object Pascal

This is the repository that will coordinate the 1 Billion Row Challenge for Object Pascal.

The One Billion Row Challenge (1BRC) is a fun exploration of how far modern Object Pascal can be pushed for aggregating one billion rows from a text file.
Grab all your threads, reach out to SIMD,  or pull any other trick, and create the fastest implementation for solving this task!

The text file contains temperature values for a range of weather stations. Each row is one measurement in the format `<string: station name>;<double: measurement>``, with the measurement value having exactly one fractional digit.
The following shows ten rows as an example:

```
Hamburg;12.0
Bulawayo;8.9
Palembang;38.8
St. John's;15.2
Cracow;12.6
Bridgetown;26.9
Istanbul;6.2
Roseau;34.4
Conakry;31.2
Istanbul;23.0
```

The task is to write an Object Pascal program which reads the file, calculates the min, mean, and max temperature value per weather station, and emits the results on `STDOUT` like this (i.e. sorted alphabetically by station name, and the result values per station in the format `<min>/<mean>/<max>``, rounded to one fractional digit):

```
{Abha=-23.0/18.0/59.2, Abidjan=-16.2/26.0/67.3, Ab√©ch√©=-10.0/29.4/69.0, Accra=-10.1/26.4/66.4, Addis Ababa=-23.7/16.0/67.0, Adelaide=-27.8/17.3/58.5, ...}
```

Submissions will be, preferably, as a `GIT` `submodule`.
They must contain the source and a Linux `ELF` binary in 64 bits in a folder named `bin` from the `root` folder.

In order to produce the One Billion Rows of text, we are providing the source code for the official generator, so we all have the same entry data.
> **NOTE**
> Generator will come shortly.

Submit your implementation and become part of the leader board!
